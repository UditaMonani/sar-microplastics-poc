# SAR-Based Feasibility Study for Marine Microplastics Detection

This repository presents a proof-of-concept study investigating whether
SAR backscatter statistics exhibit distinguishable behavior in regions
reported to have high microplastic or surfactant presence.

## Objective
To evaluate the feasibility of using Sentinel-1 SAR data to identify
surface roughness anomalies potentially associated with microplastic-induced surfactants.

## Methodology
- Sentinel-1 GRD SAR preprocessing
- Statistical and texture feature extraction
- Comparison between reported microplastic hotspots and control regions
- Physics-informed interpretation

## Status
This is an initial feasibility study intended to motivate more advanced
multi-sensor and machine learning approaches.
